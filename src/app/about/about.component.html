        Welcome to the Sanrio Market project! I am Yves-Robert Estrada, a Bachelor 3 Computer Science student. This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to understand the fundamentals of Angular. The main goal was to design and develop an online store showcasing a variety of products that we wanted. In my case I chose Sanrio plushes. By building this project, I gained valuable skills in Angular, web development. Enjoy browsing this little website!. Feel free to check the code as well on my github.
